   Entry - relative path to your application's entry point

   webpack creates a graph of all of your application's dependencies. The starting point
   of this graph is known as an entry point. The entry point tells webpack where to start
   and follows the graph of dependencies to know what to bundle.

   You can think of your application's entry point as the contextual root or the
   first file to kick off your app.

   Loaders - transform files into modules

   The goal is to have all of the assets in your project to be webpack's concern and not the browser's.
   (This doesn't mean that they all have to be bundled together). webpack treats every file
   (.css, .html, .scss, .jpg, etc.) as a module. However, webpack only understands JavaScript.

   Loaders in webpack transform these files into modules as they are added to your dependency graph.
